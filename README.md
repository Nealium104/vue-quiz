# Hi there
This is the front end to an app that I'm calling Lara-quiz for now. It's basically an anki clone that I will be improving as time goes on.

# How do I run it?
You'll need to clone, cd into the project, and then you can run `npm install && npm run dev`, but until my api is hosted, you probably will just get errors.

# What technologies are you using?
I'm using Vue, Tailwind, and Vite for build. This is pretty much the "standard" stack for Vue. On the backend, I'm using Laravel as an api with an SQLite database.
